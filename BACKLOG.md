  Add netlify - cms

    Suporte a arquivos tipo mdx
  
      Load netlify inside through mdx page
  
    Test & document

      In order to test if everything is working we need to use a beta feature from Netlify CMS to spin up a proxy server for our backend in order to test locally so we don't have to test directly with a live repo. You should run this command in a new tab/window in your cmd so you also have the next dev running.
      
      npx netlify-cms-proxy-server
